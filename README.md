Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers; it is often diagnosed late (and has few or no symptoms in early cases.) It has an average 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. [1, 5] Unfortunately, the majority of patients have unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. We propose to build a susceptibility and progression model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) based on the analysis of single-cell RNA transcriptome data from both normal tissue and tumor samples. We plan on using data from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative CELLxGENE collection [2], TCGA [3], and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) [4]. Project members are experts in the fields of molecular biology, oncology, and cancer diagnostics, with strong bioinformatics and ML experience.
